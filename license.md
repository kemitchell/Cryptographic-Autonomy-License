# 1.  License Grant

## 1.1.  Grants

Conditioned on compliance with section 2, and subject to the reservations of section 1.2, you have world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive permission to:

1.  Take any action with the Work or a Modified Work that would infringe the copyright or database protection laws of an Applicable Jurisdiction applying to the Work, including Publicly Performing any interface derived from the Work; and

2.  Take any action with the Work or a Modified Work that would infringe any patent claims Licensable by Licensor, to the extent that those claims are embodied in the Work as distributed by Licensor.

## 1.2.  Limitations on Grants

The following reservations apply to the permissions granted in section 1.1:

1.  Licensor does not grant any patent license for claims that are only infringed due to the modification of the Work or the combination of the Work, directly or indirectly, with any other component, including other Software or hardware.

2.  Licensor does not grant any license to the trademarks, service marks, or logos of Licensor, except to the extent necessary to comply with the attribution conditions in section 2.1 of this License.  Describing a Modified Work as being derived from the Work, or compatible or not compatible with the Work, is allowed as a fair or nominative use.

## 2.  Conditions

The following conditions apply to any exercise of the permissions given in section 1.  These are the only conditions imposed by this license relative to the Work; any other exercise of the permissions given in section 1 is allowed.

### 2.1.  Attribution

You must:

1.  retain all copyright, patent, or trademark notices contained in the Source Code, as well as any notices of licensing, authorship, or attribution, and 

2.  provide all such notices to each Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the use of the Software.

Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or via an easy-to-find hyperlink to an Internet location also providing Access to Source Code. 

### 2.2.  Licensed Distribution

Any distribution, Public Performance, sale, or offer for sale of the Work to a Recipient is subject to the following conditions:

#### 2.2.1.  Distribution of Source Code for an Unmodified Work

Subject to the exception in section 2.4, You must provide to each Recipient of the Work Access to all the Source Code for the Work provided, sold, or offered to the Recipient.

#### 2.2.2.  Distribution of Source Code for a Modified Work

Subject to the exception in section 2.4, You must provide to each Recipient of a Modified Work Access to Source Code corresponding to those portions of the Work remaining in the Modified Work as well as  the modifications used by You to create the Modified Work.  The Source Code corresponding to the modifications in a Modified Work must be provided to the Recipient either:

1.  under this License, or

2.  under a Compatible Open Source License.

### 2.3.  Maintaining User Autonomy

You must refrain from using the permissions given under this License to interfere with Recipient's quiet enjoyment of any Lawful Interest in their own User Data.  This includes:

1.  You may not, by means of cryptographic controls, technological protection measures, or any other method, limit a third party from independently Processing User Data in which they have a Lawful Interest;

2.  Throughout any period in which You exercise any of the permissions granted to You under this License, You must also provide to any third party with which you have an enforceable legal agreement, a no-charge copy, provided in a commonly used electronic form, of the User Data in your possession in which that third party has a Lawful Interest, to the extent that such User Data is available to You for use in conjunction with the Work;

3.  You may not use the Software to control any cryptographic keys, seeds, or hashes pertaining to third parties where such control would prevent the third party from independently exercising the permissions granted under this License;

4.  You waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technical protection measures that include use of the Work; and

5.  You waive any claim that the capabilities of the Work were limited or modified as a means of enforcing the legal rights of third parties against Recipients.

Other than the conditions in sections 2.2 and 2.3.2, nothing in this License requires You to provide processing services to anyone.

### 2.4.  Combined Work Exception

As an exception to the conditions in sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having the "Combined Work Exception," or any Object Code exclusively resulting from Source Code files so marked, may be combined with other Software into a "Larger Work." So long as you comply with the conditions in 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 relative to the Source Code provided to you by Licensor, any other Software in the Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be licensed under the terms of your choice.

## 3.  Acceptance and Remedies

By taking any action that, absent this License, would infringe Licensor's intellectual property in the Software under the laws of an Applicable Jurisdiction, You agree to the terms and conditions of this License in consideration of the permissions granted.  Any use of the Work outside the scope of this License infringes the rights of the Licensor.  In the event of infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be enforced via the intellectual property laws of the Applicable Jurisdiction.  In addition, You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You agree that either the Licensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party beneficiary) may enforce these conditions via specific performance.

## 4.  Term and Termination

The term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and continues until terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or until all Licensor's intellectual property rights in the Software expire, whichever comes first ("Term").  If this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted to You under section 1 by any Licensor automatically terminate.  You will immediately cease exercising any permissions granted in this License relative to the Work, including as part of any Modified Work.

### 4.1.  Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement

This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any of the conditions in section 2.  As a special exception to termination for non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License will automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all the conditions in section 2 within sixty days of being notified by Licensor or an intended third party beneficiary of Your noncompliance.  You are eligible for reinstatement of permissions for the Work one time only, and only for the sixty days immediately after becoming aware of noncompliance.  Loss of permissions granted for the Work under this License due to either:

1.  sustained noncompliance lasting more than sixty days or 

2.  subsequent termination for noncompliance after reinstatement,

is permanent, unless rights are specifically restored by Licensor in writing.

### 4.2.  Termination Due to Litigation

If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the Work, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You by this License shall terminate.  In the event of termination due to litigation, all permissions validly granted by You under this License, directly or indirectly, shall survive termination.  Administrative review procedures, declaratory judgment actions, and counterclaims in response to patent litigation do not cause termination due to litigation.

## 5.  Disclaimer of Warranty and Limits on Liability

### 5.2.  Disclaimer of Warranty

The Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE WORK IS WITH YOU.  This disclaimer is an essential part of this License.  No license to the Work is granted except under this disclaimer.

### 5.3.  Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or any and all other commercial damages or losses.  This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
